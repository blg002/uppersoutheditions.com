				<p>With Editions, Rosen pivots back to his early career in the New York art&nbsp;world.</p>

				<p>After graduating from The Yale School of Art & Architecture, Laurence established Chiron Press on East 11th Street. It was one of the first blue chip, limited edition print shops in America. At Chiron Press, Laurence worked with Alexander Calder, Larry Rivers, Lee Krasner, Jules Olitski, Claes Oldenburg, Alex Katz, Tom Wesselmann, to name a&nbsp;few.</p>

				<p>During this period, Laurence was also the youngest member of the esteemed Andr√© Emmerich Gallery stable of artists that included David Hockney, Sam Francis, Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Noland, and&nbsp;Anthony&nbsp;Caro.</p>
